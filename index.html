            <h3>Build Future with electrical and electronic engineering</h3>
            <p>"I chose to study EEE because I’ve always been interested how our electronic devices work and how they have been designed. Almost everything we interact with is either based around electronics or has electronic parts within them. I’m a strong believer of opening things up and trying to modify or repair them, however electronics always presented a challenge and I wanted to be able to look at a circuit board or schematic and figure out what each part did. Looking beyond University I was also conscious of career opportunities and there are many different options open to an EEE graduate, in engineering and other sectors."
